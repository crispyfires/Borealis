<p align="center">Welcome to the Borealis Wabbajack modlist! Please read this README in its entirety before playing the list.</p>
# Preamble
Borealis is a performant, vanilla+ visual overhaul for Skyrim Special Edition. It features enhanced NPCs, lighting, effects, landscapes, and flora while staying true to the vanilla aethestics. Upscaled vanilla textures form the backbone of this modlist, with choice texture and model replacements as necessary. The modlist features quality-of-life gameplay enhancements, such as diagonal movement and Fallout 4-style quickloot menus, but the vanilla gameplay otherwise remains untouched.

# Installation
## Requirements
- The English version of Skyrim Special Edition on Steam
- The Anniversary Edition DLC
- A Nexus Mods account (Nexus Premium is highly recommended)
### System Requirements
- A SSD, greatly improved loading times than an HDD
- 74 GB of disk space (49 GB install, 25 GB downloads)
#### Minimum Specs
These requirements assume that you aren't using [CS Upscaling](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/156952), which comes with the list, but is disabled by default. You probably could go lower if you enable it, or if you don't mind capping to 30 FPS instead of the 60 FPS default. These are speculative, as I don't have the setups listed to test.
